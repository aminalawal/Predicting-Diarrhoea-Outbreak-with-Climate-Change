# Predicting-Diarrhoea-Outbreak-with-Climate-Change
This repository contains the code for the project "Predicting Diarrhoea Outbreak with Climate Change".

We used CNNs, LSTMs and SVMs to predict daily number of diarrhoea cases with climate based time series data. We used Relevance Estimation and Value Calibration (REVAC) to tune the parameters of our ML algorithms. We also augmented the dataset we had available with synthetic data generated with GANs based on a modification of this paper "Real-valued (Medical) Time Series Generation with Recurrent Conditional GANs". Please refer to https://github.com/ratschlab/RGAN for the original code for the GAN implementation.
